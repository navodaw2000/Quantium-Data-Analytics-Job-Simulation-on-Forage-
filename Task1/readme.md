# Quantium Virtual Internship- Retail Strategy and Analytics- Task 1
Sales have mainly been due to Budget-older families,Mainstream-young singles/couples,and Mainstream- retirees shoppers. We found that the high spend in chips for main stream young singles/couples and retirees is due to there being more of them than other buyers. Mainstream, midage and young singles and
 couples are also more likely to pay more per packet of chips. This is indicative of impulse buying behaviour.
 We’ve also found that Mainstream youngsingles andcouples are23%morelikelytopurchaseTyrrells chips
 compared to the rest of the population. The Category Manager may want to increase the category’s per
formance by off-locating some Tyrrells and smaller packs of chips in discretionary space near segments
 where young singles and couples frequent more often to increase visibilty and impulse behaviour.
 Quantium can help the Category Manager with recommendations of where these segments are and further
 help them with measuring the impact of the changed placement. We’ll work on measuring the impact of
 trials in the next task and putting all these together in the third task.
